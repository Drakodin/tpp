# T++
T++ is web-based, pixel-driven bit shifter. This project is not associated with the decades-ago T language project and is rather a different approach to making a simple language.

## Docs
Users will not need to type anything, but rather paint pictures in a 5x3 grid using the colors provided. As a disclaimer, this project is mostly a joke, derived from an message group's name and thus relies heavily on what the topic of the group is.

This language, as stated, is a bit shifter. Users are provided with eight bits, all at 0. Users can modify this tape using a 5x3 painting grid to which inputs are given. There are specific inputs that can be used and all else will fail. These inputs are found in `tpp.js`. Try to figure out what they are. Any one of them will show an image that really shows what the background of this project is.

## Disclaimer
Again, note: this project is a joke and is not meant to be taken as social commentary. However, there will be pieces in this project that are inherently political, especially the syntax. I am aware of this. This is intentional.
